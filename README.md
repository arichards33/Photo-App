## Project 6 - Photo Phabulous

This is a photo app that allows users to keep a collection of photos that they can add from their photo library or camera. Allows for sharing on Twitter.

## Bugs:

My social share view isn't showing up, but I think that is because it doesn't work with the simulator. Also, the cacheing seems to be showing my images up out of order so the order moves around.
